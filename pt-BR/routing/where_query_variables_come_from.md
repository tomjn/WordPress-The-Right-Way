# Where Query Variables Come From

 - Mention that query variables come from the URL
 - URLs are broken down using rewrite rules into query vars
 - extra query vars can be added to any WordPress URL which is how searches work
 - Query vars have a whitelist, and they're the same as the parameters passed into WP_Query
