# The Main Loop & Template Loading

 - The main query is a WP_Query object
 - The main loop is using that main query
 - The main query is done before the template is even loaded
 - The template is loaded based on what the main query is
 - The main query is determined by parameters called query variables
 - Which template is loaded when is shown on the template hierarchy diagram
 - All templates are just custom ways of showing the main post loop
