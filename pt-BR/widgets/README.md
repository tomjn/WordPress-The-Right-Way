##Events

Running code when:


### A New Widget is Added, or Re-ordered

 - Make use of the ajaxStop event to process javascript when a widget is added or re-ordered

```javascript
jQuery( document ).ready( function( $ ) {
    function doWidgetStuff() {
        var found = $( '#widgets-right .mywidgetelement' );
        found.each( function( index, value ) {
          // process elements
        } );
    }

    window.counter = 1;

    doWidgetStuff();

    $( document ).ajaxStop( function() {
        doWidgetStuff();
    } );
} );
```

### The widget form opens
