# Behaviour Testing

Also known as Behaviour Driven Development, this kind of testing tests the entire stack. For example a behavioral test may start by visiting a webpage, clicking a button, and checking that an expected string was found.

BDD is good for testing business requirements. It generally falls into 2 types, story based testing, and code-based testing. An example of story based testing would be Behat, which uses a human readable format so that clients can read the tests in plain English ( with support for other languages included ).
